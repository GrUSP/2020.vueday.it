  extract: >
    Do you know Vue.js? Want to develop a native app? With NativeScript-Vue you can! In this talk, I will present the
    NativeScript-Vue ecosystem, and how developing production mobile apps feels like with this framework. You will
    discover what the main “haha!”s and “gotcha!”s are, specially if you come from a webdev background. In the end,
    you will know what NativeScript-Vue is in the real world, and if it is a good fit for your next native app
    development.

  title: Adaptive Vue.js Apps with The Composition API
  extract: >
    The Vue.js composition API brings us a lot of new ways to share functionality across components. I will be introducing
    how to use `vue-use-web` to tackle "adaptive" Apps that behave differently depending on various aspects of the user
    device, like their memory, battery level, and connection speed. This allows us to be more empathetic towards our
    users and that we can give them a better experience.

  title: Explaining the VuePress Magic 🧙
  extract: >
    VuePress is awesome and full of magic, I could say for multiple reasons:  as technology and as a product!
    But how is this magic happening that make VuePress sites so fast? How is VuePress doing all that awesome stuff for
    you and being very consumer-friendly? I will answer all these questions in my presentation, but before doing that I
    will take a step back and I will explain what are static site generators, why is their popularity keeps rising, how
    are they working under the hood and how is the Vue ecosystem looking.
    I will present a deep dive into how these tools work, I will show you what happens behind the scenes and what
    technologies they are using by using code samples from VuePress codebase. For example, I will explain how a markdown
    file is processed. But also I will present some interesting features that set VuePress apart in the ecosystem because
    if set up correctly VuePress can be very powerful.
    Magic is awesome but magic is even better when is explained :)

  title: Rapid development with Vue.js and Tailwind
  extract: >
    Would like to provide insights into how the combination of Vue.js and tailwindcss can make development very fast,
    yet stable and how you can grow prototypes into real production ready features with these 2 libraries. In the talk
    I would point out the benefits of tailwind and how it personally helped me and my team to have a unified css approach
    on several projects. At the end I will prepare a live coding demo and build a fully accessible small component to
    showcase why the combination of Tailwind and Vue increases developer productivity and let's you focus more on the
    core features of your application rather than finding third parties and having a hard time customizing them.

  title: SEO in a Vue.js world
  extract: >
    What do a SaaS landing page, blog and e-commerce store have in common? They should all be found through a search
    engine, ideally by as many people as possible. Search engine optimization (SEO) can therefore be decisive for the
    success and also the revenue of your projects.
    But when it comes to Vue.js and SEO, there are many controversial opinions about the impact of Vue on SEO efforts.
    In my session we will go through the basics of SEO and examine best practices and their implementations with the
    help of vue-meta and Nuxt.js.

  title: Data Visualizations and Internationalization
  extract: >
    Building custom data visualizations with full international support is not always easy. Let's go over useful
    techniques to customize data visualizations in Vue, for a global audience. How to format strings, numbers, dates,
    times, currencies, calendars, x/y axis, and more! We'll talk about the unique challenges with right to left and
    bi-directional locale visualizations, how colors, iconography, and emojis can be perceived differently in distinct
    cultures, as well as mapping and cartography for a global audience.

  title: Rebuilding Vue Storefront - biggest eCommerce Vue project with Composition API
  extract: >
    We created Vue Storefront for one purpose - to simplify eCommerce frontend development and make it enjoyable.
    We wanted to create a single framework for all major eCommerce platforms that will allow developers to work with
    modern tech stack and enjoyable APIs no matter which platform they're using.  We came a long way to achieve that goal.
    Started 3 years ago as all-in-one heavy-weight solution with our own plugin system, Redis caching, custom Server
    Side Rendering, and specific deployment strategies. It was a major simplification over typical eCommerce frontend
    but still far from the Developer Experience of modern frontend tooling.
    At the end of last year, we decided to do a rewrite of a whole platform and base it on Composition API and Nuxt.js...
    and the effect was far beyond our expectations! We managed to drastically simplify our APIs, cut down the public
    API surface more than 70%, and make the framework much more flexible, fitting in almost any environment from a
    large-scale eCommerce project to a simple product widget on a private website. If that sounds to you like a pitchy
    catchphrase from a landing page you're absolutely right - except its's truth!
    It wasn't sunshine and rainbows though - we were one of the first large-scale projects in the world to implement
    Composition API in Nuxt and we had to deal with a lot of early adopters issues.
    If you're curious how we used Nuxt and Composition API to simplify Vue Storefront and what challenges we faced don't
    miss my talk! I guarantee a lot of meat and interesting use cases!
