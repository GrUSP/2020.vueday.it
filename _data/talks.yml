  title: Adaptive Vue.js Apps with The Composition API
  extract: >
    The Vue.js composition API brings us a lot of new ways to share functionality across components. I will be introducing
    how to use `vue-use-web` to tackle "adaptive" Apps that behave differently depending on various aspects of the user
    device, like their memory, battery level, and connection speed. This allows us to be more empathetic towards our
    users and that we can give them a better experience.

  title: Explaining the VuePress Magic ðŸ§™
  extract: >
    VuePress is awesome and full of magic, I could say for multiple reasons:  as technology and as a product!
    But how is this magic happening that make VuePress sites so fast? How is VuePress doing all that awesome stuff for
    you and being very consumer-friendly? I will answer all these questions in my presentation, but before doing that I
    will take a step back and I will explain what are static site generators, why is their popularity keeps rising, how
    are they working under the hood and how is the Vue ecosystem looking.
    I will present a deep dive into how these tools work, I will show you what happens behind the scenes and what
    technologies they are using by using code samples from VuePress codebase. For example, I will explain how a markdown
    file is processed. But also I will present some interesting features that set VuePress apart in the ecosystem because
    if set up correctly VuePress can be very powerful.
    Magic is awesome but magic is even better when is explained :)

  title: Rapid development with Vue.js and Tailwind
  extract: >
    Would like to provide insights into how the combination of Vue.js and tailwindcss can make development very fast,
    yet stable and how you can grow prototypes into real production ready features with these 2 libraries. In the talk
    I would point out the benefits of tailwind and how it personally helped me and my team to have a unified css approach
    on several projects. At the end I will prepare a live coding demo and build a fully accessible small component to
    showcase why the combination of Tailwind and Vue increases developer productivity and let's you focus more on the
    core features of your application rather than finding third parties and having a hard time customizing them.

  title: SEO in a Vue.js world
  extract: >
    What do a SaaS landing page, blog and e-commerce store have in common? They should all be found through a search
    engine, ideally by as many people as possible. Search engine optimization (SEO) can therefore be decisive for the
    success and also the revenue of your projects.
    But when it comes to Vue.js and SEO, there are many controversial opinions about the impact of Vue on SEO efforts.
    In my session we will go through the basics of SEO and examine best practices and their implementations with the
    help of vue-meta and Nuxt.js.

  title: Vue at the New York Times
  extract: >
    The New York Times Care Platforms Team uses Vue/Vuex to integrate new UI components into a legacy CRM application.
    Vue allows us to add new components to our application incrementally, and further, it allows us to continue
    delivering business value to our stakeholders while chipping away at technical debt incurred by years of working
    with this vendor framework. Additionally, Vue has been at the center of all collaboration between designers and
    engineers on our team as we work together towards building up a design system which provides documentation,
    principles and guidelines to be followed by our team and others who engage with our products. The Vue-based design
    system helps us to maintain consistency and efficiency, allowing us to design, implement new features and iterate
    more quickly as a cross-functional, agile team.

  title: Data Visualizations and Internationalization
  extract: >
    Building custom data visualizations with full international support is not always easy. Let's go over useful
    techniques to customize data visualizations in Vue, for a global audience. How to format strings, numbers, dates,
    times, currencies, calendars, x/y axis, and more! We'll talk about the unique challenges with right to left and
    bi-directional locale visualizations, how colors, iconography, and emojis can be perceived differently in distinct
    cultures, as well as mapping and cartography for a global audience.

  title: Rebuilding biggest eCommerce Open Source Vue project with Composition API	
  extract: >
    With almost 6k GitHub stars, vibrant community of more than 2000 developers, 40+ partner agencies and hackathons
    happening every few weeks all around the world (New York, Tel Aviv, Germany, Netherlands to name a few) organized
    by companies like Tom Tailor, Vue Storefront is currently the most popular Open Source eCommerce Storefront in the world!
    We came a long way. Started 3 years ago as all-in-one heavy-weight solution with our own plugin system, Redis caching,
    custom Server Side Rendering and specific deployment strategies.
    Now weâ€™re in process of moving to much lighter architecture. Core of our software which previously was enormously
    huge codebase right now is just a set of TypeScript interfaces ensuring that all parts of the systems are working
    correctly with each other.
    Everything else is based on Nuxt.js and modular pluggable integrations written in Composition API. 
    If youâ€™re curious:
    - how we built such a successful open source project from scratch in just 2 years
    - what challenges we needed to face (scalability, extendibility etc) and how Vue helped us with them
    - why we choose Vue and how itâ€™s helping us to be ahead of others in the industry who choose to use React for their solutions
    - what architectural decisions we made to  and how they evolved 
    - How we moved from gigantic monolithic architecture to fully modular and lightweight solution with Compositon API
    This is a talk for you!
