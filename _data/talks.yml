How to format strings, numbers, dates, times, currencies, calendars, x/y axis, and more! We'll talk about the unique challenges with right to left and bi-directional locale visualizations, how colors, iconography, and emojis can be perceived differently in distinct cultures, as well as mapping and cartography for a global audience."

  title: Vue at the New York Times
  extract: > "The New York Times Care Platforms Team uses Vue/Vuex to integrate new UI components into a legacy CRM application. Vue allows us to add new components to our application incrementally, and further, it allows us to continue delivering business value to our stakeholders while chipping away at technical debt incurred by years of working with this vendor framework. Additionally, Vue has been at the center of all collaboration between designers and engineers on our team as we work together towards building up a design system which provides documentation, principles and guidelines to be followed by our team and others who engage with our products. The Vue-based design system helps us to maintain consistency and efficiency, allowing us to design, implement new features and iterate more quickly as a cross-functional, agile team."
