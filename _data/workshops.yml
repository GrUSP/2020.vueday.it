    intro: |
      Nuxt.js is an app-level framework for building Vue.js applications that will make a developer's life easier.
      The framework offers features like Server Side Rendering, Static Site Generation and automatic code splitting to
      make sure your front-end is production-ready and has great performance.
      In this workshop, we will develop a near-real-life app with Nuxt.js together, from creating the project to the

    intro: |
      Companies aim to create robust and quality products that satisfy their users needs, and as a developer you have
      the power to help achieving that goal.
      Testing takes a great part on this: it doesn't only make sure the code you're creating works, but also helps
      making sure the user requirements are met and to create a sustainable architecture, helping with refactoring,
      and much more.
      This workshop will lead you to learn all you need to know to test your Vue.js applications step by step and in
      the most practical way possible, where you will create tests yourself.
      By the end of it, you will be able to test a Vue.js application following best practices.

      - Introduction to testing: What/Why/How to test, types of tests, parts of a test.
      - Testing your JavaScript code: First "hello world" test, tests structure, testing practices, TDD
