    intro: |
      Nuxt.js is an app-level framework for building Vue.js applications that will make a developer's life easier.
      The framework offers features like Server Side Rendering, Static Site Generation and automatic code splitting to
      make sure your front-end is production-ready and has great performance.
      In this workshop, we will develop a near-real-life app with Nuxt.js together, from creating the project to the
      final deployment.
      During this process we will take a look at many features Nuxt.js offers and also show common pitfalls and how to
      avoid them.
