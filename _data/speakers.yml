      Over the last 15 years in the development business, Tiago did a bit of everything until finally landing in the
      soft arms of Vue.js. He is very excited with the possibility of using Vue with NativeScript and so he has been
      helping with the nativescript-vue community effort for some time. Currently working for IRC.com.
